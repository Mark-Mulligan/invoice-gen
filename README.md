## Description 
I built this application for one of my friends who is a private music teacher.  He spends a lot of time putting together invoices for the parents of the students he teachers each month.  This program is designed to streamline that process.  I also included a way to save and organize a roster of students.  This data is present to the user in the form of table to can be easily searched and sorted. 

I used google oauth to login in the users, mongoDB to store all the nessary data, and the react-pdf package to create and generate professional invoices that can be downloaded and used as needed.

#### Dashboard

* On this page, the users profile information is displayed.  It is automatically populated from their google account but can be changed and saved for later.  Here the user can also view a table of all their students.  They can add, edit, or delete students from this table.  The table is sortable by each column and there is a global search function as well.

#### Invoice Page

* This page is used to generate invoices.  The form is automatically populated with your profile data.  Simply select the student would like to create the invoice for.  When this is done, the rest of the their data will be automatically populated in the form.  However, if you would like, you can change any information in the form you want.  When you are done filling out the form, click generate PDF.  This will show you a preview of your generated pdf.  Click download pdf on the top of the preview screen.  If you wish to make changes, simply change the information in the form and click update PDF.
