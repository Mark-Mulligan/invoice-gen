## Description 
I built this application for one of my friends who is a private music teacher.  He spends a lot of time putting together invoices for the parents of the students he teachers each month.  This program is designed to streamline that process.  I also included a way to save and organize a roster of students.  This data is present to the user in the form of table to can be easily searched and sorted. 

I used google oauth to login in the users, mongoDB to store all the nessary data, and the react-pdf package to create and generate professional invoices that can be downloaded and used as needed.  

#### Built With
* React.js
* Node.js
* MongoDB
* Boostrap
* [react-pdf](https://github.com/diegomura/react-pdf)
